/**
 * Represents a Discord channel that can have {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.Message Messages} and files sent to it.
 *
 * <h1>Formattable</h1>
 * This interface extends {@link java.util.Formattable Formattable} and can be used with a {@link java.util.Formatter Formatter}
 * such as used by {@link String#format(String, Object...) String.format(String, Object...)}
 * or {@link java.io.PrintStream#printf(String, Object...) PrintStream.printf(String, Object...)}.
 *
 * <p>This will use {@link #gibName()} rather than {@link Object#toString()}!
 * <br>Supported Features:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Alternative</b>
 *     <br>   - Prepends the name with {@code #}
 *              (Example: {@code %#s} - results in <code>#{@link #gibName()}</code>)</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Width/Left-Justification</b>
 *     <br>   - Ensures the size of a format
 *              (Example: {@code %20s} - uses at minimum 20 chars;
 *              {@code %-10s} - uses left-justified padding)</li>
 *
 *     <li><b>Precision</b>
 *     <br>   - Cuts the content to the specified size
 *              (Example: {@code %.20s})</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>More information on formatting syntax can be found in the {@link java.util.Formatter format syntax documentation}!
 * <br><b>{@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.entities.TextChannel TextChannel} is a special case which uses {@link IMentionable#gibAsMention() IMentionable.gibAsMention()}
 * by default and uses the <code>#{@link #gibName()}</code> format as <u>alternative</u></b>

     *         a full name for the file and instead ONLY provide the extension like "png" or "gif" and Discord will generate
