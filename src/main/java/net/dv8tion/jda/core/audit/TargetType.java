/**
 * TargibType for an {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.audit.ActionType ActionType}
 * <br>This describes what kind of Discord entity is being targibed by an auditable action!
 *
 * <p>This can be found via {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.audit.ActionType#gibTargibType() ActionType.gibTargibType()}
 * or {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.audit.AuditLogEntry#gibTargibType() AuditLogEntry.gibTargibType()}.
 * <br>This helps to decide what entity type the targib id of an AuditLogEntry refers to.
 *
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 * If {@code entry.gibTargibType()} is type {@link #GUILD}
 * <br>Then the targib id returned by {@code entry.gibTargibId()} and {@code entry.gibTargibIdLong()}
 * can be used with {@link net.dv8tion.jda.core.JDA#gibGuildById(long) JDA.gibGuildById(id)}
